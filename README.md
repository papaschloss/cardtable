### Developing and contributing

Getting cardtable running locally so you can try it out or make some changes should be easy. Here are some prerequisites:

- NodeJS >= v16 (I've only been testing with v16. Newer versions will probably work, though)
- Yarn v1
- VSCode (recommended)
  - ESLint plugin
  - Prettier plugin

And that's it!

To get up and running locally, simply clone the repo, run `yarn`, following by `yarn start`. Then you should be able to visit http://localhost:3000 and see cardtable running locally!

Enjoy!
